<h1>Egg-SGML</h1>

In the tumultuous aftermath of the world discovering that HTML was based on a standard that was not freely available, and had not formalized the document tree though it had brought it about, a few things seem to have gotten lost.
<p/>
It must be noted that the clarity (and strictness) of the XML standard was not appreciated, and web-browsers continued to parse whatever they could see their way to making something out of.
<p/>
It must also be noted that DTD's are only useful for verification, and in practice verification only happens during loading. They are not useful for those wanting to hand-craft an XML document. With an SGML document they would have been useful to know when a tag is self-closing, but the XML standard quite sensibly enforces that all tags must be explicitly closed: so that the document tree is apparent without any further context.
