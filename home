<record id="title">Egg-SGML Test</record><record id="content">

This is an example website for Egg-SGML, which continues from the <a href="/show-readme">README</a> file of the project. <p/>

Something potentially unique about this site is that it is almost completely transparent: all source documents are displayed. <p/>

We start with this home page:<p/>
<div class="source"><div class="tweakA"/><showsource path="home" highlight="record play include showsource"/><div class="tweakB"/></div>

<p/><p/>
You will no doubt be wondering about the tags <u>showsource</u>, <u>record</u>, and <u>include</u>. These will be described after contrasting this page with another: <a href="/eggs-play-nation">the explanation</a>.
