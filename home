<p>This is an example website for Egg-SGML, which continues from the <a href="/show-readme">README</a> file of the project. </p>

<p>Something potentially unique about this site is that it is almost completely transparent: all source documents are displayed. </p>

<p>We start with this home page:</p>

</div>
<div class="source"><div class="tweakA"/><div class="w3-container w3-theme-l5">
<showsource path="home" highlight="record play include showsource"/></div><div class="tweakB"/></div>
<div class="w3-container w3-theme-l5">

<p>You will no doubt be wondering about the tags <u>showsource</u>, <u>record</u>, and <u>include</u>. These will be described after contrasting this page with another: <a href="/eggs-play-nation">the explanation</a>.</p>
