Here we reach the goal of full transparency, starting with nav.include, included by header_footer.include, which was displayed on the explanation page: <p/>

<div class="source"><div class="tweakA"/><showsource path="nav.include" highlight="record play include showsource a.site"/><div class="tweakB"/></div>

<p/><p/>As may be guessed, <u>a.site</u> allows us to highlight the current page in the navigation.
<p/><p/>
We also show you the .htaccess file in use:<p/>
<div class="source"><div class="tweakA"/><showphp path=".htaccess"/><div class="tweakB"/></div>

<p/><p/> And finally, the source document of this page (egg-sourced):<p/>

<div class="source"><div class="tweakA"/><showsource path="egg-sourced" highlight="record play include showsource showphp"/><div class="tweakB"/></div>

<p/><p/>Cheers!
