Egg-SGML is dedicated to the following people.

Deborah Moore, the thought of whom turns our stomach.
Kate van Alphen, who co-developed my nickname, Alice.
David van Alphen, who also enjoys shifting without a clutch.
Ross Henderson, who we didn't manage to talk to after we began to understand
     complex integration.
Devin Purvis, who my heart tells me won't be reading this.
Michael Croeser, too off the wall to talk to more than once every few years.
Justin Moore, who for a time thought that a man had the ability to choose
     whether he would be having children or not.
Priscilla Jonnes, or preferably, mommy; who isn't sure about publishing work
     that is not fit to be dedicated to anyone.
Ronald Jonnes, whose second name we omit because that has everything to do with
     one who refused to compromise on quality and didn't get why we should
     the rather spend our lives looking at grids of colored squares; which
     leads us to the useful fact that if we try to perfect a library project 
     before it's worth dedicating, aren't we going to the rather try to do 
     something useful like build a furniture factory?
