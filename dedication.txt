Egg-SGML is dedicated to the following people.

Deborah Moore, the thought of whom turns our stomach.
Kate van Alphen, who co-developed my nickname, Alice.
David van Alphen, who also enjoys shifting without a clutch.
Ross Henderson, who we didn't manage to talk to after we began to understand
     complex integration.
Devin Purvis, who my heart tells me won't be reading this.
Michael Croeser, too off the wall to talk to more than once every few years.
Justin Moore, who for a time thought that a man had the ability to choose
     whether he would be having children or not.
Priscilla Jonnes, or preferably, mommy.
Ronald George Jonnes.
