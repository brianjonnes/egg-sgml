It is annoying when you think about publishing something which
you've spent a lot of time thinking about and find it necessary
to think about people who aught to be mentioned because while our
parents only encourage us, it are those who cross our paths
who have no reason to give us their support who give us a pointer
here and there as to how we're within the cot of our parents'
way of thinking which is only going to give us their praise,
which comes to us no matter what we do.

It's a lot more annoying when we find that a person we'd like to
dedicate something to is not someone that we think anyone knows
as we do.

This project was started simply enough, as anyone knows how
a project might start. But there was no grounding. Thus it took
eleven years for me to realize that I needed to make an HTML
parser in a scripting language.

This is not very efficient, but those who wrote parsers that
we could use tended to think that the SGML specification was
not good enough. I certainly did, myself; for it seems to be just
a suggestion.

Thus I leave this in the same vein, while my dad tries to worry me
to death with his.
