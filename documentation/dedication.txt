Egg-SGML was started as any project starts.  But it took me eleven 
years to realize that I needed to make an HTML parser in a 
scripting language.

This is not very efficient. But we need to take it as axiomatic
that dynamic websites cannot be built with a compiled 
language. This is not easy for one who at least knows what an 
axiom is not.

SGML is a specification which to one who believes that 
communication without words can only communicate what animals
can communicate without words, is perplexing. This was certainly 
a hurdle which compounded with the aforementioned.

Thanks a lot for your support, mothers and daughters everywhere.
